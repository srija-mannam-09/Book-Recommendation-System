# Book-Recommendation-System

**Project Overview: Book Recommendation System**

Developed a book recommendation system using PySpark, leveraging the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) collaborative filtering algorithm.

**Data Preparation for Collaborative Filtering:**

Pre-processed the dataset to extract relevant item/user/rating information.
Formatted the data to make it suitable for collaborative filtering.

**Model Creation and Forecast Error Determination:**

Implemented a collaborative filtration model using the ALS algorithm.
Evaluated forecast errors to ensure accuracy and reliability.

**Refinement Through Cross-Validation:**

Applied cross-validation techniques using PySpark tools like CrossValidator and ParamGridBuilder.
Systematically experimented with diverse hyperparameter combinations to enhance model efficiency compared to the initial model.

**Robust Book Recommendation System:**

Designed and implemented a highly robust book recommendation system.
Leveraged PySpark's ALS collaborative filtering for precise and effective predictions.
**
Hyperparameter Exploration:**

Explored various combinations of hyperparameters to fine-tune the recommendation model.
Iteratively refined the model through a systematic cross-validation process.

**Algorithm Utilization: ALS Collaborative Filtering**

Utilized the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) collaborative filtering algorithm for its effectiveness in making accurate predictions.

**Enhanced Model Efficiency:**

Through the experimentation with hyperparameter combinations and cross-validation, achieved a more efficient recommendation model compared to the initial implementation.

**Systematic Cross-Validation:**

Employed cross-validation techniques to validate the robustness and effectiveness of the recommendation system.
Ensured the model's reliability and adaptability to diverse user preferences.
